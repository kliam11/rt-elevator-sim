# SYSC 3303 C2 Project

## Info
"Elevator control system and simulator. The system will consist of an elevator
controller (the Scheduler), a simulator for the elevator cars (which includes,
the lights, buttons, doors and motors) and a simulator for the floors (which
includes, buttons, lights and last, but not least, people who are too lazy to
take the stairs). The elevator controller will have to be multi-threaded since
it is expected to handle more than one car at a time. Your simulation should be
configurable in terms of the number of floors, the number number of elevators,
the time it takes to open and close the doors, and the time it takes to move
between floors."
